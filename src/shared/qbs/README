Build Instructions
==================
Prerequisites:
   * Qt 5.6.0 or later
   * On Windows:
     -  MinGW or Visual Studio
   * On macOS: Xcode

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Qbs with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

You can also build and develop Qbs using Docker. For more information,
see "Appendix A: Building Qbs" in the Qbs Manual.
